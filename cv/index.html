Python Developer and Data Specialist

I have been working as a Python Software Engineer and Data Specialist for over four years, developing and extending Scrapy spiders to scrape a massive varity of data in numerous formats, working on a rich variety of projects to design schemas, develop filters for collecting explicit and implicit information from complex, unstructured data, using informal natural language processing, and developing search algorithms for enriching data on the fly, applying automation to the generation and running of Python scripts. I have worked on some ambitious projects, including a custom search engine for a patent trading platform, data enrichment for threat feeds and automation solutions for searching, downloading and parsing pdfs in multiple languages.

I am fascinated by the potential of data, when combined with the techniques in Data Science and Software Engineering, and have a personal interest in designing custom search and recommendation engines. I am currently in the process of solidifying knowledge of the Python full stack, and Machine and Deep Learning techniques in order to obtain a greater understanding of how to innovate with data and implement state-of-the-art software.

Career History
Self-employed (July 10th 2015 – present)
Working on a number of projects, including automation solutions for downloading and parsing pdf government documents, designing classification algortihms for renaming and allocating files to specific directories, and complex regular expressions for parsing unstructured data. 

Solidifying my knowledge of the Python full stack - building REST APIs with Flask, MongoDB, PostGreSQL, and  machine learning techniques inclusing  - regression, classification, clustering, association rule learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, linear discriminant analysis and model selection and boosting. 

SECONDBRAIN (January 2018 - present) – Data scientist and Machine Learning Python developer
Schema design, topic modelling with gensim, building and deploying local virtual evironments. Using GitLab for integrated software deployment.

Automated cybercrime and intelligence investigations (March 2017 – present)
Working with a cybercrime specialist I built a range of python automation tools for data scraping and enrichment. We developed specialist python libraries for the purpose of deanonymisation, analysis and exploration of natural language processing approaches. The collaboration led to new understandings of extensible software development patterns.

Gainownership (March – September 2017) - Technical consultant for a state of the art recommender system for social welbeing. 
I consulted and researched for an ambitious project to build a gamified AI chat bot therapist platform. 

This involved the design of data schemas from social media APIs, including Facebook and Twitter for chatbot integrations. There was a broad investigation of different sorts and recommender systems such as Google.ai, IBM Watson and python libraries for implementing machine learning functionality.

inventtory Ltd (November 2016 – May 2017) - Data mining, data research, python software development and consulting. 
I produced a bespoke search tool and algorithm for automating querying, generating explicit and implicit data on patents, wrangling data on the fly, and outputting data to various formats. 

I managed the whole project and supported operational hand over to the client.

Argonaut (June – December 2016)
I developed against the corporatation’s custom automated data harvesting framework to ingest new data sources for the company. This involved website application analysis, testing and software consultency.

John Snow Labs (January 2016 - April 2016) - Cyber Security Analyst & Data Researcher  
I performed a number of roles on this challenging cyber security project. These involved researching and ingesting various blacklists on the internet for investigating different types of malware sources. Data was harvested via Scrapy and python scripts to develop bespoke threat feeds.

The aggregated data was curated, parsed, cleaned, updated and published on a daily basis via an end to end pipeline of data ingestion and publishing scripts. Alongside the feed I produced a comprehensive data catalog of useful cyber security public and licensed data for further integrations with associated data and metadata standards.

Other tasks involved penetration testing, network scanning, log analysis, mentoring and managing junior team members.

International Truth and Justice Project – Sri Lanka (June - July 2015) - Research and Data Extraction. 
Using PowerShell and regular expressions, I extracted the names, positions, ranks and dates of appointment of members of the Sri Lankan army.

Friday Media Group (April 2013 – July 2015) - Junior Developer. 
I began my data career building 100’s of Kofax Kapow robots for extracting a diverse range of data from a range of web sources. This involved building scripts to harvest data on client’s websites, debugging, updating snippets and new robot models. Managing the live databases on the backend systems, associated data mapping functions and SQL Management Studio.

Here I developed an excellent grasp of regular expressions, an intuition for patterns and an aptitude for interpreting the structure of HTML, to find optimal methods for scraping data. As I moved into a more senior role, I was involved in the mentoring of junior team members, code reviews and managing software standards.
